## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Setup Redis (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Automatic Redis setup
python scripts/setup_redis.py

# Or install manually:
# macOS: brew install redis
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install redis-server
# CentOS: sudo yum install redis
```

### 3. Generate Synthetic Data

```bash
cd src
python data_gen.py
```

This creates `data/raw/clinical_data.csv` with 20,000 realistic patient records.

### 4. Train the Model with MLflow Tracking

```bash
# Option A: Run with MLflow tracking (recommended)
python scripts/run_with_tracking.py

# Option B: Run without MLflow tracking
cd src
python train.py
```

### 5. Generate CLV Predictions

```bash
cd src
python clv_utils.py
```

This creates `predictions/predictions_with_clv.csv` with churn probabilities and CLV values.

### 6. Start All Services (Enhanced)

```bash
# Start all services with Redis and async support
python scripts/start_services.py
```

This will start:
- **Redis Cache** on port 6379
- **FastAPI Backend** on port 8000 (with async endpoints)
- **Streamlit Frontend** on port 8501 (with async support)
- **MLflow UI** on port 8080

### 7. Test Performance (Optional)

```bash
# Run performance tests to see improvements
python scripts/performance_test.py
```

# In api/main.py
redis_client = redis.Redis(
    host='localhost',
    port=6379,
    db=0,
    decode_responses=True,
    socket_connect_timeout=5,
    socket_timeout=5,
    retry_on_timeout=True,
    health_check_interval=30
)
```

### Cache TTL Settings
```python
# Cache time-to-live settings
CACHE_TTL = 3600  # 1 hour for predictions
EXPLANATION_CACHE_TTL = 1800  # 30 minutes for explanations
```

### Async Concurrency Limits
```python
# Thread pool for CPU-intensive operations
executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)

# Semaphore for batch predictions
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent=10)
```

## 📈 Monitoring and Analytics

### Cache Statistics
```bash
# View cache statistics
curl http://localhost:8000/cache/stats
```

Response includes:
- In-memory cache size
- Redis connection status
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Memory usage statistics

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Run performance tests
python scripts/performance_test.py
```

Tests include:
- Single prediction performance
- Batch vs parallel vs sequential
- Caching effectiveness
- Load testing with concurrent requests

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Redis Issues
```bash
# Check Redis installation
redis-server --version

# Test Redis connection
redis-cli ping

# Start Redis manually
redis-server

# Setup Redis automatically
python scripts/setup_redis.py
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check cache statistics
curl http://localhost:8000/cache/stats

# Run performance tests
python scripts/performance_test.py

# Monitor system resources
htop  # or top
```

### Async Operation Issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install aiohttp redis cachetools`
- Check Redis connection in health endpoint
- Monitor thread pool usage in logs
- Verify async/await syntax in custom code

## 📋 Updated Requirements

### Core Dependencies

# Install with async and caching support
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

New dependencies include:
- `redis` - Redis client for caching
- `cachetools` - In-memory caching utilities

- `aiofiles` - Async file operations
- `httpx` - Modern HTTP client

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8+ (3.11+ recommended for best async performance)
- **Redis**: 6.0+ (optional but recommended)
- **Memory**: 4GB+ RAM for optimal caching
- **CPU**: Multi-core recommended for async operations

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Use async operations** for I/O-bound tasks
2. **Implement caching** for expensive computations
3. **Handle Redis failures** gracefully with fallbacks
4. **Monitor cache hit rates** for optimization
5. **Use batch endpoints** for multiple predictions

### For Production
1. **Configure Redis persistence** for data durability
2. **Set up Redis clustering** for high availability
3. **Monitor memory usage** and cache eviction
4. **Implement rate limiting** for API endpoints
5. **Use connection pooling** for database operations

## 🚀 Migration from v1.0

### Breaking Changes
- API version updated to 2.0.0
- New batch prediction endpoint
- Enhanced response schemas
- Additional health check fields

### Backward Compatibility
- All v1.0 endpoints remain functional
- Existing client code continues to work
- Gradual migration to async operations supported

### Upgrade Steps
1. Update dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install Redis (optional): `python scripts/setup_redis.py`
3. Restart services: `python scripts/start_services.py`
4. Test new features: `python scripts/performance_test.py`
